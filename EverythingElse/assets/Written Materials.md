## Survey Form

Do you like strategy games that make you think for ages before every move? Really hard games that require several attempts per level? Really long games that take over 100 hours to beat, with levels that last more than 90 minutes? Games with Gacha type mechanics where there's only a chance you'll get what you need after beating a level, except without in app payments so the only option if you fail is to replay the level?
